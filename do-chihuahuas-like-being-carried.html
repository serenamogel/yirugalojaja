However, this of course can vary from dog to dog - like us humans, they all have their individual likes and dislikes. Chihuahuas can be wary of strangers, so do not try to pick up or carry one unless you're sure they are comfortable with you.</span></span> <span class=report-it><a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">&nbsp;Takedown request</a></span> <a class=view-url href=# rel="noopener nofollow">View complete answer on trustedhousesitters.com</a><h2>Do Chihuahuas like to be picked up?</h2>Chihuahuas, like many other small dog breeds, can be more prone to anxiety and fear due to their size and vulnerability.
