The series quickly went viral and was later picked up for official publication by Shueisha’s Young Jump Web Comics in 2012. The story follows the adventures of Saitama, a superhero who can defeat any opponent with a single punch, but becomes bored with his own power and struggles to find worthy opponents. The manga has been adapted into an anime series and has become a cultural phenomenon, with merchandise, spin-offs, and video games. The series is still ongoing with the latest chapter being released weekly.</p><p>In this article, we’ll be taking a look at what to expect from One Punch man Manga Chapter 185, including Raw Scan Release date, Reddit Spoilers, release date, and where to read.</p><h2><strong>One Punch man Manga Chapter 185 Release Date</strong></h2><p>The fans of One Punch Man will have immediate access to the upcoming chapter. The publication of One Punch Man Chapter 185 is planned for midnight on May 18, 2023 Confirmed by his author.</p><p>The publication of the issue is scheduled for the following times in the relevant time zones:</p><ul><li>Pacific Daylight Time: 18th May 2023, Thursday, 3:00 AM</li><li>Central Daylight Time: 18th May 2023, Thursday, 5:00 AM</li><li>Eastern Daylight Time: 18th May 2023, Thursday, 6:00 AM</li><li>British Summer Time: 18th May 2023, Thursday, 18:00 AM</li><li>Central European Time: 18th May 2023, Thursday, 12:00 PM</li><li>Indian Standard Time: 18th May 2023, Thursday, 3:30 PM</li><li>Japanese Standard Time: 18th May 2023, Thursday, 7:00 PM</li><li>Korean Standard Time: 18th May 2023, Thursday, 7:00 PM</li><li>Australia Central Daylight Time: 18th May 2023, Thursday, 7:30 PM</li><li>Chinese Standard Time: 18th May 2023, Thursday, 6:00 PM</li><li>Singapore Standard Time: 18th May 2023, Thursday, 6:00 PM</li><li>Philippines Standard Time: 18th May 2023, Thursday, 6:00 PM</li></ul><h2><strong>One Punch man Manga Chapter 185 Speculation</strong></h2><p>In the upcoming chapter 185 of One Punch Man, the mysterious new Hero Association is expected to reveal itself. Although their current membership count is unknown, they have already recruited the Vigilante Group Hunters and Super Sumo, as well as secretly contacting several S-Rank heroes. It remains unclear why people trust this new group, but Genos’s inclusion might provide some insight into their inner workings. However, since Saitama is his master, Genos is unlikely to join unless Saitama asks him to. Nonetheless, this presents a golden opportunity for all heroes to join their cause and make a difference.</p><h2><strong>Where to read One Punch Man Latest Manga Chapter</strong></h2><p>On Tonarinoyj, you can read the series’ past releases in raw format as well as the upcoming One Punch Man Chapter 185. You can access the Viz Media website and app to read in English, but the most recent chapter isn’t there, so you’ll have to wait till Chapter 185 is available.</p><h2 id=h-one-punch-man-chapter-184-summary><strong>One Punch Man Chapter 184 Summary</strong></h2><p>The battle between Tatsumaki and Saitama finally ended, with Saitama being the clear winner. Tatsumaki, however, didn’t want to concede easily and tried to launch Saitama into space. Unfortunately, she only managed to lift him a few feet off the ground before she began bleeding from her head and passed out due to the strain. Saitama woke her up and was irritated when Tatsumaki said she would try another surprise test once she heals.</p><p>Fubuki arrived on the scene and expressed her desire to fight Tatsumaki, but she changed her mind about her subordinates. Eventually, things resolved between the Psychic Sisters, and Fubuki collaborated with Mr. McCoy to cover up the events. To do this, they scattered parts of monster carcasses around the battlefield and claimed that Tatsumaki singlehandedly repelled a pack of Demon-level monsters that attacked the Hero Association HQ. Since the cameras were offline, no one could refute their claim, and Tatsumaki’s ratings went up.</p><p>As a result of the increased publicity, Tatsumaki landed a commercial gig to recruit potential heroes, which turned out to be a hit. However, she wasn’t happy that they had used AI to alter the footage and make her look “cute.” Additionally, there appears to be a new organization secretly recruiting heroes to establish a new Hero Association, but no other details are known about it yet. It seems that they have already recruited a sizable army of newer generation heroes.</p><p>Read More:&nbsp;Chainsaw Man Chapter 128: The Emergence of a New Chainsaw Man</p><p>One Punch Man Chapter 183 Reveals Shocking Traitor: Gearspur’s Storyline and Implications</p><p>Infinite Mage Chapter 34 Raw Scan, Spoilers, Release Date</p><p>Get the latest from Sportslumo.com by following us on&nbsp;Instagram,&nbsp;<a href=#>Twitter</a>, and&nbsp;YouTube</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmhqZGy7psPSmqmorZ6Zwamx1qippZxemLyue82erqxnn6OybrzUp5qhZZ2Wu265wKeemmWTna6xwMSrZGpwZWK%2FprjEmqqeZZSWwaZ50qmmoqSVp8Burc2dZLCglaeybsDOZqmemZRk</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fone-punch-man-manga-chapter-185-release-date-spoilers-and-where-to-read.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fone-punch-man-manga-chapter-185-release-date-spoilers-and-where-to-read.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fone-punch-man-manga-chapter-185-release-date-spoilers-and-where-to-read.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fone-punch-man-manga-chapter-185-release-date-spoilers-and-where-to-read.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fone-punch-man-manga-chapter-185-release-date-spoilers-and-where-to-read.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fone-punch-man-manga-chapter-185-release-date-spoilers-and-where-to-read.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./vegan-alfredo-sauce.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./vegan-alfredo-sauce.html>Vegan Alfredo Sauce</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./football-players-with-long-hair-spotlight-on-lamar-jackson.html>Football Players With Long Hair: Spotlight On Lamar Jackson</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./football-players-with-long-hair-spotlight-on-lamar-jackson.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
