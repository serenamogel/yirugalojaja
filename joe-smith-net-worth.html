His collection of high-end vehicles expanded to include a Corvette, a Bentley and two Range Rovers. When A-Rod contacted Joe in the middle of 2018, he was instructing basketball and earning around $26,000 annually, but he was also drowning in debt from mounting monthly expenses.</p><p>Despite making over $61 million during his 16-year NBA career, Joe Smith’s net worth was only around one-third of this total.
