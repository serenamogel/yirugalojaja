With her approachable ease that doesn’t come off haughty or disconnected, and her easy- to-remember melodies and songs, it’s understandable on pretty much every level why she’s so famous.</p>Recommended Videos<p data-characters=312 data-current-count=312 data-injectable=false>It’s a fame that seems to inspire a dedication seemingly reserved for The Beatles or Eminem in his prime, but it also has what seems like its own identity. Swift is a once-in-a-generation talent and performer, and within that sphere it’s easy to forget she’s also just a person like you and me.</p><p data-characters=209 data-current-count=521 data-injectable=true>I mean, a very, very talented and wealthy person who can’t even go to a grocery store without being mobbed by teens, but a person nonetheless. Just like any of us, she dates and falls in and out of love.</p><p data-characters=281 data-current-count=281 data-injectable=false>The difference is, of course, the fame means that people are interested. Her fans are invested in her life and they want to know who she’s dating, when and for how long. The other side of that coin is she’s so famous she can pretty much date whoever the heck she wants.</p><p data-characters=301 data-current-count=582 data-injectable=true>Honestly, who wouldn’t want to date one of the world’s most famous women? I bet even my mom would at least give it a thought. Because of this, TaylorvSwift has quite the rolodex of famous beaus, from the crooning John Mayer to the brooding Taylor Lautner to the presidential Conor Kennedy.</p><p data-characters=439 data-current-count=439 data-injectable=true>It can be hard to keep track, right? No worries, I got you. Here’s an exhaustive list of America’s favorite musician’s boyfriend history. Disclaimer: Swift has had a lot of boyfriends, and I am a journalist and not a Swiftie. We will update this exhaustive piece if we miss something, but there is <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">a lot</a> of <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">information</a> out there <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">about this</a> and not all of it is the same.

The two apparently dated in high school and he was reportedly the one who inspired the classic Swift tune “Tim McGraw.” Say what you will, Swift knows how to put words together. Check out these lyrics:</p><p>“Just a boy in a Chevy truck<br>That had a tendency of gettin’ stuck<br>On backroads at night<br>And I was right there beside him all summer long<br>And then the time we woke up to find that summer gone”</p><p data-characters=284 data-current-count=492 data-injectable=true>Unrequited love! Romance! It’s got it all. How weird would it be for the most momentous thing you do in your life is date one of the world’s most famous pop stars before they were famous? You were so close, Borello! Who knew that going away to college was such a bad idea?</p><h3 data-injectable=false>Jordan Alford</h3><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false><p lang=pt dir=ltr>1) antes da fama (antes de 2008): nós temos alguns namoradinhos/crushs de adolescência como Drew Dunlap e Drew Hardwrick, Jordan Alford e Sam Armstrong.

He supposedly inspired the song “Picture to Burn,” and the two attended Hendersonville High School together in Tennessee. Alford apparently left her for a classmate named Chelsea.</p><p data-characters=125 data-current-count=125 data-injectable=false>Alford and Chelsea later married, and Chelsea told <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Daily Mail</a> that she was friends with Swift until Alford came between them.</p><p data-characters=233 data-current-count=358 data-injectable=false>‘We were kind of good friends at school, later not so much. She dated him, that’s why,” she said. I wonder if he regrets it. It kind of feels like that moment in Indiana Jones when the Nazi dude <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">picks the wrong cup</a>.</p><h3 data-injectable=false>Drew Hardwick</h3><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" data-current-count=658 data-injectable=true><p lang=en dir=ltr>Drew Hardwick, subject of Taylor Swift’s "Teardrops on My Guitar," arrested for child abuse: <a href=#>https://t.co/CJL9b8W2fE</a> <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/98D2uUqLJk</a></p>— Vulture (@vulture) <a href=#>December 29, 2015</a></figure><p data-characters=258 data-current-count=258 data-injectable=false>Hardwick has the distinction of apparently inspiring Swift’s breakout hit “Teardrops on My Guitar.” She’s gone <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">on record</a> saying that Hardwick is a real person. Here’s some irony: Hardwick didn’t even know she was into him!</p><p data-characters=229 data-current-count=487 data-injectable=true>Swift shared that two years after the song came out he showed up at her home and asked her on a date. Too little too late, Hardwick! It’s for the best, though, because he was arrested on charges of <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">child abuse</a> back in 2015.</p><h3 data-injectable=false>Sam Armstrong</h3><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-tiktok wp-block-embed-tiktok" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false><a title=@theswiftsource href=#>@theswiftsource</a><p>Taylor Swift’s high school ex went on a reality show to talk about her <a title=swifttok href=#>#swifttok</a> <a title=swiftie href=#>#swiftie</a> <a title=taylorswift href=#>#taylorswift</a></p><a title="♬ That Girl - 阿森" href=#>♬ That Girl – 阿森</a></figure><p data-characters=234 data-current-count=534 data-injectable=true>There’s a theme developing here, and that theme is that people seem to cheat on Swift. Add Sam Armstrong to that list. It’s not a total loss, though, because we got the song “Should’ve Said No” out of it.</p><p data-characters=342 data-current-count=342 data-injectable=false>In her CD booklet for her first album, she capitalized every S, A, and M in the correct order. Woof. Armstrong seems to have taken a more confrontational approach about the whole thing, and trashes Swift on social media. And not just social media, he went on a talk show! That video is above. Other songs are understandably about him as well.</p><p data-characters=186 data-current-count=528 data-injectable=true>How about this comment on the aforementioned video: “I cannot fathom how a person could ever cheat. ESPECIALLY ON TAY??? SHE WAS LITERALLY A GORGEOUS COUNTRY BARBIE DOLL?!??”</p><p data-characters=63 data-current-count=63 data-injectable=false>I mean, cheating is crappy no matter how you spin it, but sure.</p><h3 data-injectable=false>Joe Jonas</h3><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" data-current-count=363 data-injectable=false><p lang=en dir=ltr>i can’t believe one of the most hauntingly beautiful songs of all time were written about this era of joe jonas… taylor swift is so unserious <a href=#>#SpeakNowTaylorsVersion</a> <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/WO1Q19iAZB</a></p>— Ruby Naldrett (@rubynaldrett) <a href=#>July 7, 2023</a></figure><p data-characters=250 data-current-count=613 data-injectable=true>Ok, now we’re getting into the fame years. The majority of boyfriends from here on out are people pretty well-known and don’t need that much explaining. Joe Jonas is one of the Jonas Brothers, a popular boy band from the 2000s and beyond.</p><p data-characters=183 data-current-count=183 data-injectable=false>Jonas apparently broke up with her on a 30-second phone call, something she bemoaned on an episode of The Ellen DeGeneres Show. Better than a text, to be honest, as we’ll see later.</p><p data-characters=166 data-current-count=349 data-injectable=false>Songs about Jonas include “Forever & Always” and “Last Kiss.” “Better Than Revenge” is reportedly about <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">his ex, Camilla Belle</a>.</p><h3 data-injectable=false>Lucas Till</h3><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram" data-current-count=649 data-injectable=true><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by Lucas Till (@lucastill)</a></p></figure><p data-characters=234 data-current-count=234 data-injectable=false>Swift dated then Hannah Montana star Lucas Till <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">briefly after Jonas</a>. They ended their romance amicably and became friends. He even appeared in the “You Belong With Me” video. He told MTV he just liked her more as a friend.</p><p>“We dated for a little bit. But, there was no friction because we were too nice. We just really both liked each other … [but] most relationships work out cause you get along and then you don’t, and then you make up and its passionate, and with us I really just liked her as a friend. That’s the only reason that didn’t work out.”</p><p data-characters=134 data-current-count=134 data-injectable=false>That’s a very mature way of looking at things. Not all of her relationships end this sweetly. He’s doing fine, by the way.</p><h3 data-injectable=false>Taylor Lautner</h3><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" data-current-count=434 data-injectable=true><p lang=en dir=ltr>que chsm taylor swift, que viva taylor lautner <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/Tcopy4kpWA</a></p>— ane 🌱 ⁰¹⁵ ` ⁰⁰⁷ 🧪 (@roierstarr) <a href=#>July 7, 2023</a></figure><p data-characters=360 data-current-count=360 data-injectable=false>Lautner was one of the hottest heartthrobs on earth back in the day, especially after he appeared in the Twilight movies. The two started dating after they met on the set of the movie Valentine’s Day. Apparently he was more into her than she was into him, and the song “Back to December” is thought to be an apology song to him. These lyrics:</p><p>“You gave me roses, and I left them there to die… So this is me swallowing my pride, standing in front of you saying I’m sorry for that night… You gave me all your love and all I gave you was goodbye.”</p><p data-characters=22 data-current-count=22 data-injectable=false>They broke up in 2010.</p><h3 data-injectable=false>John Mayer</h3><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" data-current-count=322 data-injectable=false><p lang=en dir=ltr>John Mayer shared a cryptic post to Instagram on Thursday, just hours before the release of Taylor Swift's new version of 'Speak Now,' featuring the message 'please be kind.' <a href=#>https://t.co/B4WDUrjl4y</a></p>— Entertainment Weekly (@EW) <a href=#>July 7, 2023</a></figure><p data-characters=189 data-current-count=511 data-injectable=true>Firstly, no one should feel bad for John Mayer. He has quite the dating history himself, and it’s perhaps inevitable that these two incredibly talented and famous humans got together.</p><p data-characters=445 data-current-count=445 data-injectable=true>What’s pretty crazy is that like Lautner, she apparently broke it off with Mayer, so much so that he wrote a song about her, called “Paper Dolls.” But we’re not here to talk about Mayer. The song “Dear John” is <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">definitely about him</a> and “Ours”, “Superman”, “The Story of Us”, “I Knew You Were Trouble” and “Would’ve, Could’ve, Should’ve” are all rumored to be.</p><h3 data-injectable=false>Cory Monteith</h3><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false><p lang=en dir=ltr>Taylor Swift and Cory Monteith 🤍🤍🤍 <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/53vT5B2iCk</a></p>— we🫀 Louis (@loving_louis_GF) <a href=#>August 25, 2021</a></figure><p data-characters=253 data-current-count=553 data-injectable=true>RIP Cory. This is a sad one <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">because of what happened to Monteith</a> back in 2013, but the couple apparently dated very briefly and unofficially in 2010. She was asked about their relationship on Ellen, and she blushed a little when the host brought him up.</p><p data-characters=77 data-current-count=77 data-injectable=false>When he died she tweeted: “Speechless. And for the worst reason.”</p><p data-characters=55 data-current-count=132 data-injectable=false>The song “Mine” is rumored to be about him.</p><h3 data-injectable=false>Adam Young</h3><p data-characters=230 data-current-count=362 data-injectable=false>Adam Young is more of a footnote than an ex. He’s the guy from that annoying band Owl City who wrote that song about hugging fireflies. The song caught Swift’s attention and she wrote “Enchanted” about him.</p><p data-characters=122 data-current-count=484 data-injectable=true>When he finally made his move, as is the Swift way, she was already on to another. Too bad, Adam, go be with your insects.</p><h3 data-injectable=false>Jake Gyllenhaal</h3><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by Page Six (@pagesix)</a></p></figure><p data-characters=254 data-current-count=554 data-injectable=true>Gyllenhaal holds the distinction of being one of the few (maybe the only) person to break up with Swift through text. In the beginning, he pulled out all of the stops for her. He spent $160k on a private jet for a date (man, it must be great to be rich).</p><p data-characters=252 data-current-count=252 data-injectable=false>The rumor is that Gyllenhaal couldn’t get past their 10-year age difference, but that’s a pretty weak excuse. At some point, we have to maybe realize that Swift is maybe terrible at relationships, or she just uses them to write more songs.</p><p data-characters=95 data-current-count=347 data-injectable=false>She got a bunch out of this one, like the song “All Too Well,” with these lyrics:</p><p data-characters=302 data-current-count=649 data-injectable=true>“Left my scarf there at your sister’s house. And you’ve still got it in your drawer even now” and “Now you mail back my things and I walk home alone, But you keep my old scarf from that very first week ‘Cause it reminds you of innocence and it smells like me.”</p><p data-characters=58 data-current-count=58 data-injectable=false>He’s also been seen wearing said scarf, apparently.</p><h3 data-injectable=false>Chad Overstreet</h3><p data-characters=146 data-current-count=204 data-injectable=false>Another rumored footnote. This one hasn’t been confirmed, but there’s a <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">picture of them</a> maybe on a date, so he’s making the cut.</p><h3 data-injectable=false>Eddie Redmayne and Zac Efron</h3><p data-characters=197 data-current-count=401 data-injectable=true>These two are getting lumped together because neither got a song and some dispute that they actually dated. I’m including them for completionist purposes and because I take my job seriously.</p><h3 data-injectable=false>Conor Kennedy</h3><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false><p lang=en dir=ltr>Taylor Swift goes on a date with boyfriend of 1 month, Conor Kennedy, to the gravesite of his mother Mary Kennedy, who had died 3 months prior (August 2012) <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/uTg5zzV7Vv</a></p>— caleb (@calebstark) <a href=#>July 5, 2019</a></figure><p data-characters=218 data-current-count=518 data-injectable=true>Conor is the grandson of current presidential candidate Robert F.
