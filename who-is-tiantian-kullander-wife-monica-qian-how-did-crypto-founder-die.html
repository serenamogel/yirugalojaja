<time>31 Mar 2024, 00:00</time></div></div><p><strong>Following the news of Tiantian Kullander’s death, curiosity in his wife has grown.</strong></p><p>Tiantian Kullander was a revered thought leader and a well-known industry pioneer. His expertise, his openness to collaborate, and his unwavering drive to help others have helped many companies and individuals.</p><p>Numerous projects, people, and communities were inspired by his inventiveness and ideas.</p><p>Before giving it to the community, Tiantian co-founded KeeperDAO, the first on-chain liquidity underwriter. He co-founded Amber, a multibillion-dollar financial unicorn, and was on the board of Fnatic, one of the most successful e-sports companies in the world.</p><p>Conspiracy theorists and anti-vaccine campaigners will probably make assumptions because Kullander died abruptly and as predicted; after all, a few weeks earlier, another crypto billionaire unexpectedly went away.</p><h2><span id=Wife_of_Tiantian_Kullander_Monica_Qian_Who_Is_She>Wife of Tiantian Kullander: Monica Qian: Who Is She?</span></h2><p>Tiantian Kullander and his spouse, Monica Qian, had been living together. Together, they also have a little kid.</p><p>The private information pertaining to his wife is still unknown.</p><p>Along with industry veterans, including former employees of Goldman Sachs Group and Morgan Stanley, Kullander created Amber in 2017. He had previously worked for both massive companies as a trader, and in 2019 he was granted a coveted place on the Forbes 30 Under 30 list.\</p><p>The business, which valued itself at an incredible $3 billion, obtained $200 million in investment earlier this year.</p><h2><span id=Tiantian_Kullander_How_Did_He_Die>Tiantian Kullander: How Did He Die?</span></h2><p>The sudden death of Tiantian Kullander, a young cryptocurrency creator who was just thirty years old, occurred.</p><p>Co-founder of the Hong Kong-based digital asset company Amber Group, Tiantian Kullander, died suddenly on November 23. The tragic news was confirmed on the company website.</p><p>After announcing his loss, the company honored him as a “loving” father and “devoted” spouse in a statement that was placed on its website. They showed how he devoted himself fully to the company during all phases of its growth and set a great example with his humor, kindness, modesty, diligence, and inventiveness.</p><p>His coworkers fondly referred to him as “TT,” and he was regarded as a renowned thought leader and well-known industry pioneer by the company.</p><p>There was nothing more known about Kullander’s demise save that he passed away while he was sleeping.</p><h2><span id=Tiantian_Kullander8217s_net_worth_when_he_passed_away>Tiantian Kullander’s net worth when he passed away</span></h2><p>The block states that Tiantian Kullander’s estimated net worth was $3 billion at the time of his death.</p><p>His professional history is significant since he co-founded Amber Group. Most individuals would have needed to put in a great deal of work and dedication to get to the top of their industry. Effort and positivity are essential for success.</p><p>He started out in the financial industry at Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs as a market trader. In 2017, Kullander and many insiders in the financial industry, including former workers of Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs Group Inc., created Amber.</p><p>Prior to that, he was employed by these two enormous financial companies as a trader. In 2019, Forbes recognized him as one of the most promising young business leaders and included him in their list of 30 Under 30.</p><p>When it was disclosed earlier this month that the Company was paying almost $US100 million for him, the Company referred to him as “essential to the foundation of Amber and a pillar of our success”.</p><p>A Forbes report from earlier this year claims that Temasek, a state investor, assisted Amber Group in raising S$275 million, or around $200 million, in a capital round. The cryptocurrency company’s worth surged to an astounding S$4.1 billion (US$3 billion) as a result.</p><p><span data-sheets-root=1 data-sheets-value='{"1":2,"2":"Also Read: Is Deadliest Catch&#39;s Josh Harris Wed?
