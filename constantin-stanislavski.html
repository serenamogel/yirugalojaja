He co-founded the Moscow Art Theatre in 1897 and developed a performance process known as method acting, allowing actors to use their personal histories to express authentic emotion and create rich characters. Continually honing his theories throughout his career, he died in Moscow in 1938.</p><h2 data-node-id=3 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">Early Life and Career</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=4 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Stanislavski was born Konstantin Sergeyevich Alekseyev in Moscow, Russia, in January 1863. (Sources offer varying information on the exact day of his birth.) He was part of a wealthy clan who loved theater: His maternal grandmother was a French actress and his father constructed a stage on the family's estate.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=7 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Alekseyev started acting at the age of 14, joining the family drama circle. He developed his theatrical skills considerably over time, performing with other acting groups while working in his clan's manufacturing business. In 1885, he gave himself the stage moniker of Stanislavski â€” the name of a fellow actor he'd met. He married teacher Maria Perevoshchikova three years later, and she would join her husband in the serious study and pursuit of acting.</p><h2 data-node-id=8 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">Opening the Moscow Art Theatre</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=9 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">In 1888, Stanislavski founded the Society of Art and Literature, with which he performed and directed productions for almost a decade. Then, in June 1897, he and playwright/director Vladimir Nemirovich-Danchenko decided to open the Moscow Art Theatre, which would be an alternative to standard theatrical aesthetics of the day.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=11 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">The company opened in October 1898 with Tsar Fyodor Ivanovich by Aleksey K. Tolstoy. The theater's subsequent production of The Seagull was a landmark achievement and reignited the career of its writer <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/authors-writers/anton-chekhov data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Anton Chekhov" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Anton Chekhov</a>, who went on to craft plays specifically for the company.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=13 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Over the following decades, the Moscow Art Theatre developed a stellar domestic and international reputation with works like The Petty Bourgeois, An Enemy of the People and The Blue Bird. Stanislavski co-directed productions with Nemirovich-Danchenko and had prominent roles in several works, including The Cherry Orchard and The Lower Depths.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=15 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">In 1910, Stanislavski took a sabbatical and traveled to Italy, where he studied the performances of Eleanora Duse and Tommaso Salvini. Their particular style of performance, which felt free and naturalistic in comparison to Stanislavski's perception of his own efforts, would greatly inspire his theories on acting. In 1912, Stanislavski created First Studio, which served as a training ground for young thespians. A decade later, he directed Eugene Onegin, an opera by <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/musicians/pyotr-ilyich-tchaikovsky data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky</a>.</p><h2 data-node-id=16 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">Stanislavski Method</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=17 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">During the Moscow Art Theatre's early years, Stanislavski worked on providing a guiding structure for actors to consistently achieve deep, meaningful and disciplined performances. He believed that actors needed to inhabit authentic emotion while on stage and, to do so, they could draw upon feelings they'd experienced in their own lives. Stanislavski also developed exercises that encouraged actors to explore character motivations, giving performances depth and an unassuming realism while still paying attention to the parameters of the production. This technique would come to be known as the "Stanislavski Method" or "the Method."</p><h2 data-node-id=18 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">Later Years, Death and Legacy</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=19 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">The Moscow Art Theatre undertook a world tour between 1922 and 1924; the company traveled to various parts of Europe and the United States. Several members of the theater decided to stay in the United States after the tour was over, and would go on to instruct performers that included <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/actors/lee-strasberg data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Lee Strasberg" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Lee Strasberg</a> and Stella Adler. These actors in turn helped to form the Group Theatre, which would later lead to the creation of the Actors Studio. Method acting became a highly influential, revolutionary technique in theatrical and Hollywood communities during the mid-20th century, as evidenced with actors like <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/actors/marlon-brando data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Marlon Brando" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Marlon Brando</a> and Maureen Stapleton.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=21 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">After the 1917 Russian Revolution, Stanislavski faced some criticism for not producing communist works, yet he was able to maintain his company's unique perspective and not contend with an imposed artistic vision. During a performance to commemorate the Moscow Art Theatre's 30th anniversary, Stanislavski suffered a heart attack.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=23 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Stanislavski spent his later years focusing on his writing, directing and teaching. He died on August 7, 1938, in the city of his birth.</p><ul data-node-id=26 class="css-yzf9pi e1k3dme10"><li>Name: Constantin Stanislavski</li><li>Birth Year: 1863</li><li>Birth City: Moscow</li><li>Birth Country: Russia</li><li>Gender: Male</li><li>Best Known For: Constantin Stanislavski was a Russian stage actor and director who developed the naturalistic performance technique known as the "Stanislavski Method" or method acting.</li><li>Industries</li><ul class="css-yzf9pi e1k3dme10"><li>Theater and Dance</li></ul><li>Death Year: 1938</li><li>Death date: August 7, 1938</li><li>Death City: Moscow</li><li>Death Country: Russia</li></ul><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=28 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">We strive for accuracy and fairness.If you see something that doesn't look right,<a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/contact-us data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="contact us" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">contact us</a>!</p><br data-node-id=29><ul data-node-id=31 class="css-yzf9pi e1k3dme10"><li>Article Title: Constantin Stanislavski Biography</li><li>Author: Biography.com Editors</li><li>Website Name: The Biography.com website</li><li>Url: https://www.biography.com/actors/constantin-stanislavski</li><li>Access Date:</li><li>Publisher: A&amp;E; Television Networks</li><li>Last Updated: May 21, 2021</li><li>Original Published Date: April 2, 2014</li></ul><ul data-node-id=34 class="css-yzf9pi e1k3dme10"><li>The main factor in any form of creativeness is the life of a human spirit, that of the actor and his part, their joint feelings and subconscious creation.</li><li>Remember: there are no small parts, only small actors.</li><li>Unless the theatre can ennoble you, make you a better person, you should flee from it.</li><li>Love the art in yourself and not yourself in the art.</li></ul><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7o7XOoKmaqJiue6S7zGiYnKyfp8Bwr86nqq2Znqm2r3nSrZinoaOhrre%2FyqI%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fconstantin-stanislavski.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fconstantin-stanislavski.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fconstantin-stanislavski.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fconstantin-stanislavski.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fconstantin-stanislavski.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fconstantin-stanislavski.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./crime-punishment-2018.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./crime-punishment-2018.html>Crime + Punishment movie review (2018)</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./can-you-go-to-university-without-a-levels.html>Can you go to university without A Levels?</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./can-you-go-to-university-without-a-levels.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
