When Fualaau was 12, he became sexually involved with Letourneau, his 34-year-old married schoolteacher. Their illegal relationship was discovered when Letourneau became pregnant with Fualaau’s child in 1997, and she went to prison after pleading guilty to two counts of child rape. Fualaau and Letourneau eventually married in 2005 and had two children together before divorcing in 2019. The scandalous nature of their relationship received widespread attention and served as loose inspiration for the 2023 movie May December.</p><h2 data-node-id=9 title="Quick Facts" data-anchor-id=quick-facts class="body-h2 css-a5dq20 e1iypdkw1">Quick Facts</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=10 class="body-tip css-i9osfz e1k3dme10">FULL NAME: Vili Fualaau<br>BORN: June 26, 1983<br>SPOUSE: Mary Katherine Letourneau (2005-2019)<br>ASTROLOGICAL SIGN: Cancer</p><h2 data-node-id=11 title="Early Life" data-anchor-id=early-life class="body-h2 css-a5dq20 e1iypdkw1">Early Life</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=12 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Born June 26, 1983, as one of four children of Soona and Luaiva Fualaau, Vili Fualaau first met Mary Kay Letourneau while he was in second grade. She later became his sixth-grade teacher at Shorewood Elementary School in Burien, Washington.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=13 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">A popular teacher and a married mother of four, Letourneau initially took Fualaau under her wing and encouraged his artistic talents. He spent time at her house, and she encouraged a friendship between him and her oldest child, Steve, who was only a year younger than him.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=14 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">According to some interviews, Fualaau has claimed to be the one that sought to change their friendship into a romantic relationship. He thought about what he could do to win her over, telling Dateline television news magazine that “I remember I used to like plan the next day, like ‘What I was gonna do, what was gonna say, what I was gonna like—what surprise I was gonna leave on her desk.’” Letourneau claimed that she saw him as more of a man than a young teenager.</p><h2 data-node-id=15 title="Relationship with Mary Kay Letourneau" data-anchor-id=relationship-with-mary-kay-letourneau class="body-h2 css-a5dq20 e1iypdkw1">Relationship with Mary Kay Letourneau</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=16 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">During the summer after sixth grade, Fualaau celebrated his 13th birthday. Just days prior, he became sexually involved with Letourneau. Both Fualaau and Letourneau were concerned with keeping the relationship a secret, however, Letourneau later said she didn’t understand that her involvement with the minor was legally considered rape.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=17 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">The police did catch them together in her van once, parked at a local marina at night. They questioned Fualaau and Letourneau, who both denied any wrongdoing. The officers also called Fualaau’s mother, who said that it was okay for him to be there with her.</p><h6 class="css-9e7625 e9ikml3"><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p0"></span><span class="css-8lle59 e9ikml1">Keep Reading</span><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p1"></span></h6><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=20 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">In 1997, Letourneau became pregnant with Fualaau’s child. Her husband learned about her relationship with Fualaau, and one of his family members tipped off the authorities. Soon after, Letourneau was arrested on statutory rape charges. She gave birth to daughter Audrey that May, making Fualaau a father for the first time at age 14. Fualaau’s mother received temporary custody of the child.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=21 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">At first, Fualaau kept his identity hidden during the legal proceedings against Letourneau. He still gave comments to the press, explaining to Washington TV station KIRO that Letourneau’s pregnancy was no accident. “We made a plan. The only way to keep us together was to have a baby, so that baby would remind me of her,” he told a reporter. The family later sued the station for invasion of privacy.</p><h2 data-node-id=22 title="Mary Kay Letourneau’s Incarceration" data-anchor-id=mary-kay-letourneaus-incarceration class="body-h2 css-a5dq20 e1iypdkw1">Mary Kay Letourneau’s Incarceration</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=23 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Letourneau later pled guilty to two counts of child rape and was given a sentence of six months to seven years in prison. Released into a sex offender treatment program after six months, Letourneau refused to stay away from Fualaau, despite a court order. The two were soon caught together by police in her car, and Letourneau went back to jail for the rest of her sentence in 1998.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=24 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">During their brief time together, Letourneau became pregnant with their second child. Their daughter Georgia was born while Letourneau served her sentence. Once again, Fualaau’s mother stepped in to care for the couple’s new baby.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=25 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">That same year, Fualaau went public by selling his story to television and news outlets. He and Letourneau tried to explain their unusual relationship in the 1999 book Un suel crime, l’amour (Only One Crime, Love), which was published in France. Going through a difficult time, Fualaau struggled with the notoriety surrounding the case. He did a lot of partying for a time and dropped out of school.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=26 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">In 2002, Fualaau and his family sued the school district and the police for failing to stop the relationship. He claimed to be suffering emotionally as a result of his relationship with Letourneau and said he was no longer in love with the mother of his children. Apparently, the jury didn’t believe him; they ruled in favor of the defendants.</p><h2 data-node-id=27 title="14-Year Marriage to Mary Kay Letourneau" data-anchor-id=14-year-marriage-to-mary-kay-letourneau class="body-h2 css-a5dq20 e1iypdkw1">14-Year Marriage to Mary Kay Letourneau</h2><img alt="vili fualaau walking into a house with mary kay letourneau to his left" title="Mary Kay Letourneau and Vili Fualaau" width=3000 height=2182 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/mary-letourneau-and-her-fiance-vili-fualaau-enter-their-news-photo-1704393001.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><span class="css-eqbp25 eewc14j1">Getty Images</span><p>Mary Kay Letourneau and Vili Fualaau are seen together in May 2005 in Normandy Park, Washington.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=29 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Soon after Letourneau’s release from prison in 2004, Fualaau, then 21 years old, had the restraining order against Letourneau lifted. He and Letourneau soon got engaged. In May 2005, the couple married at a winery in Woodinville, Washington. They sold their wedding video to the press.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=30 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Eventually reunited with their children, Fualaau and Letourneau established a home in a suburb of Seattle.

When Doran questioned Letourneau about the illicit nature of the start of their relationship, she turned to Fualaau and asked him: “Who was the boss? Who was the boss back then?” After several awkward silences, Fualaau eventually said that he “was the pursuer” in their relationship.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=33 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Meanwhile, the relationship was beginning to unravel. In May 2017, Fualaau legally separated from Letourneau, but according to an interview he allegedly gave Radar Online, it was a financial decision made by the couple due to his desire to start a marijuana business. “It’s not necessarily what you think,” he told the magazine about the separation filing. “When you want to get licensed, they do background checks on both parties. If I decide to be a part of it, I have to be licensed, and I have to be vetted, and so does a spouse. She has a past. She has a history.”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=34 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">However, in August 2017, speaking through his lawyer, Fualaau claimed that he never gave an interview to Radar and that he was proceeding with the separation, despite Letourneau’s desire for reconciliation, as revealed in court documents. The couple eventually finalized their divorce in 2019.</p><h2 data-node-id=35 title="DUI Arrests" data-anchor-id=dui-arrests class="body-h2 css-a5dq20 e1iypdkw1">DUI Arrests</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=36 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">In February 2018, Fualaau was arrested for drunk driving and subsequently hit two cars in Burien, Washington.
