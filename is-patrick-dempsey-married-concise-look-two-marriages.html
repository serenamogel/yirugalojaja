<time>13 May 2024, 00:00</time></div></div><p><strong>Patrick Dempsey played Derek Shepherd, a talented doctor with an amazing family on “Grey’s Anatomy,” but is he married in real life? And who is the lucky woman to covet the McDreamy smile?</strong></p><p>Patrick Dempsey has earned a reputation for himself in Hollywood. And it isn’t just about being a “very great fake doctor” but also a definition of the ideal family man. What’s not to admire about him?&nbsp;</p><p>Playing the kind, beloved doctor who stole the hearts of his onscreen partner Dr Meredith Grey (Ellen Pompeo), his patients, colleagues, and millions of viewers for eleven years. He was indeed quite the catch.</p><p>Top that off with all the McDreamy moments spent with his three onscreen kids and talented wife. Okay, so he is the perfect gentleman onscreen, and dare we say, everyone’s dream doctor, dad and partner.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram"></figure><p>So while having him as a doctor in real life might be off the charts without an actual stint in med school, which lucky woman has managed to win him over as a partner in real time? Is Patrick Dempsey even married?</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Is_Patrick_Dempsey_Married></span><strong>Is Patrick Dempsey Married?</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>In November 2022, Patrick Dempsey <a href=#>reminisced</a> on some of the most important moments in his life, with his time in the movie, “Enchanted” taking the top spot.</p><p>During the premiere of the long-anticipated sequel of the fantasy comedy, “Disenchanted,” the star explained why the movie held a special place in his heart. He <a href=#>divulged</a>:</p><p><strong>“We found out during the course of the first movie that my wife was pregnant with twins. That was halfway through the shoot. And my daughter was a few years old at the time.”</strong></p><p>So yes, Patrick Dempsey is married and has a loving relationship with his <a href=#>wife</a>. The two even have kids growing by leaps and bounds, something most folks would never have imagined outside his life on “Grey’s Anatomy.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/gistfest.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Patrick-Dempsey-Poses-For-Rare-Family-Photo-With-Adorable-Twin-Sons-12-Gorgeous-Daughter-17-1.jpeg><p>More interesting is that he has exchanged vows more than once. Continue reading to find out more about the present wife of Patrick Dempsey and his two <a href=#>marriages</a>.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Who_Is_Patrick_Dempsey_Married_to></span><strong>Who Is Patrick Dempsey Married to?</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>Patrick Dempsey is currently married to hairstylist and longtime wife, Jillian Fink. The two <a href=#>tied the knot</a> in 1999 and have been together for 23 years and counting.</p><p>This isn’t to say their marriage has been devoid of hurdles and pitfalls. However, with love serving as their guiding light, the couple has managed to surpass all marital woes.</p><p>Their relationship began with their first meeting in 1994. At the time, Dempsey booked a session with Fink as his hairstylist. The stylist admittedly thought the booking was a hoax until the famous actor showed up in person at her LA salon, Delux.</p><p>Despite being shocked by his presence, Fink admitted she felt happy seeing how cute he was. When they first met, Dempsey was married to his first wife, while the entrepreneur also had a partner.</p><p>Notwithstanding, they hit it off immediately and enjoyed three years of occasional haircuts and platonic chatters. They began dating in 1999 and moved in together just three months later.</p><p>Patrick Dempsey and Jillian Fink got married in 1999 at his family’s farmhouse. They proceeded to start a family three years into their marriage.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/gistfest.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/20221130_081036-1.jpg><p>The couple welcomed their first child, Tallulah Fyfe, in February 2002. Then in February 2007, they had twin boys, Sullivan Patrick, and Darby Galen.</p><p>Their marriage hit rock bottom in early 2015, causing Fink to file for divorce, citing irreconcilable differences. Their differences reportedly stemmed from Dempsey’s overcommitment to work.</p><p>Thankfully, the twosome found a means of <a href=#>rekindling</a> their affection, eventually reconciling. They dismissed the divorce case in November 2016, a year after reconciling. Jillian Fink and Patrick Dempsey have enjoyed marital bliss ever since in the company of their beautiful children.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Dempseys_First_Wife></span><strong>Dempsey’s First Wife</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Patrick Dempsey was only 21 years old when he <a href=#>married</a> his manager Rochelle “Rocky” Parker, 47 at the time. But that marriage did not stand the test of time and even saw its fair share of scandals.</p><p>During their post-divorce court proceedings, Patrick Dempsey’s ex-wife, 26 years his senior, accused him of physically abusing her. In the court papers, Rocky recalled him allegedly beating her up on the set of “Can’t Buy Me, Love,” claiming he wanted to see what it felt like to beat up a woman.</p><p>In another instance, she accused him of slamming a van door on her finger. The talent manager also claimed Dempsey left her for another woman, which resulted in their marriage falling apart.</p><p>Rochelle Parker, who passed away in 2014, eventually retracted her claims of domestic violence. Patrick Dempsey once spoke on his marriage to first wife, admitting in 2006 that he married Rocky because of his underlying “mummy issues.”</p><p>It turns out even the beloved, picture-perfect Derek Shepherd roleplayer battled his fair share of personal demons in real life but still managed to dish out his iconic <a href=#>McDreamy moments</a> onscreen.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmifmajBp7HSrWWcp51ktrR5z5qrq6GToHqlscypqp6xXaKus77Inptmm5%2BjsKq%2FxGajqKebYsG4u4ymmKuqmZa0pr%2BO</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fis-patrick-dempsey-married-concise-look-two-marriages.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fis-patrick-dempsey-married-concise-look-two-marriages.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fis-patrick-dempsey-married-concise-look-two-marriages.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fis-patrick-dempsey-married-concise-look-two-marriages.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fis-patrick-dempsey-married-concise-look-two-marriages.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fis-patrick-dempsey-married-concise-look-two-marriages.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./the-bridges-of-madison-county-1995.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./the-bridges-of-madison-county-1995.html>The Bridges Of Madison County movie review (1995)</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./how-much-money-does-mathew-knowles-make-latest-mathew-knowles-net-worth-income-salary-html.html>How Much Money Does Mathew Knowles Make?
