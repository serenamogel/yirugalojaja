Because.</p><p>What a time the 2010s were.</p><p>But now I get to live out my junior high sunflower seed dreams (vicariously, through Rhett & Link, of course) and find out which flavor of David sunflower seeds is the best flavor in <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">this episode of Good Mythical More</a> that aired back in March of 2021. Let’s get crackin’! (Oh, and if you’re curious what the Sporked crew has to say on the matter, check out their ranking of <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">the best sunflower seed flavors</a>.)</p><p class=has-small-font-size>The following article contains affiliate links that may generate a small commission to us when you make a purchase through the link.

Why do I think that? Because he didn’t like these; they were too sweet for him. Rhett, on the other hand, loved this flavor. The spice is mild and the sweetness balances nicely.</p><strong><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Dill Pickle</a></strong><p>Rhett liked these, and began his review of them with, “MMMM this works.” Link thought these were fine, noting that they taste great but he’s not sure he could eat them for the duration of a whole movie. Another topic that was happening at the same time: Both Rhett & Link said they thought possums have a lifespan of between two to five years, though they live longer if they are from Virginia. I did fact check this (on Wikipedia, so take it with a few hundred grains of salt), and they are correct on both fronts. Then they moved on to talk about how they’ve wanted to put their hands in a possum’s mouth. They then clarified: This would be a professional possum, not a regular one—perhaps one from Free Willy 2 (which I also checked, and, while I could be mistaken, it would seem this movie about a whale does not contain even a trace of possum).</p><strong><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Sour Cream & Onion</a></strong><p>This is the first flavor Rhett & Link really loved. When Link first tried these he said, “Oooh Rhett, sour cream and onion are gooooood, boy!” Rhett then tried them and said, “MMM!” Meanwhile link Link was telling a story about a dream he had where he accidentally kicked someone and it left a bruise. That is to say, there isn’t much else to say about these other than that Rhett said he really liked them, too.</p><strong><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Cracked Pepper</a></strong><p>Cracked pepper was a “home run.” Both Rhett & Link loved it. Link tried it and immediately told Rhett that “cracked pepper is SO GOOD.”</p><p><strong>The Worst of the Worst (so you know what to avoid):</strong> The Spicy Queso flavor was BAD. Link even called it both “horrible” and “nasty.” The BBQ flavor was also not good; they both had audible negative reactions to it. Ranch was “a bit much,” according to Link, and the Buffalo Ranch tasted like bleu cheese and was “horrible,” according to Link, and “not coming together for me,” according to Rhett.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube"><a href=# class="lazy-load-youtube preview-lazyload preview-youtube" data-video-title="We Try Every Sunflower Seed Flavor" title='Play video "We Try Every Sunflower Seed Flavor"' rel=noopener>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ZppBaKQ-Mw</a></figure><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiroKS%2FrLHDZ5qopV%2BWv7W1wqWcaKqYmsG1ecuipaRll6K6brDAr6CdZaOqu6e4zrCcq2WjmrKlv44%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2frhett-link-gmm-david-sunflower-seeds.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2frhett-link-gmm-david-sunflower-seeds.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2frhett-link-gmm-david-sunflower-seeds.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2frhett-link-gmm-david-sunflower-seeds.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2frhett-link-gmm-david-sunflower-seeds.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2frhett-link-gmm-david-sunflower-seeds.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./shane-keough-wiki-age-wife-net-worth-height-family-parents-baseball-wife-brittany-mcgowan-and-instagram.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./shane-keough-wiki-age-wife-net-worth-height-family-parents-baseball-wife-brittany-mcgowan-and-instagram.html>Shane Keough Wiki, Age, Wife, Net Worth, Height, Family, Parents, Baseball, Wife (Brittany Mcgowan)</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./lim-chong-yah-daughter-lim-suet-fern-lim-suet-lynn.html>Lim Chong Yah Daughter Lee Suet Fern and Lim Suet Lynn?</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./lim-chong-yah-daughter-lim-suet-fern-lim-suet-lynn.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
