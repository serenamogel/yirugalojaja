She worked as a professional model before joining Wheel in 1982, alongside <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/movies-tv/a44188952/pat-sajak-career-as-wheel-of-fortune-host data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Pat Sajak" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Pat Sajak</a>.

Her parents divorced when Vanna was an infant, and she was raised by her mother, Joan, and stepfather, Herbert White Jr., in North Myrtle Beach.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=11 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">After graduating from high school, White moved to Atlanta, where she attended the Atlanta School of Fashion and worked as a model. She headed to Los Angeles in 1979 to pursue an acting career, but in the summer of 1980, she returned briefly to South Carolina to see her mother, who was dying of ovarian cancer.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=12 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">White returned to Hollywood with renewed resolve and earned a series of minor acting jobs in largely forgettable films, including the role of Mickey in Gypsy Angels (1980); a bit part in Looker (1981), starring alongside Albert Finney; and the small role of Doris in the high school thriller Graduation Day (1981). She also appeared in one episode of the TV series Star of the Family in 1982.</p><h2 data-node-id=13 title="'Wheel of Fortune' Host" data-anchor-id=wheel-of-fortune-host class="body-h2 css-a5dq20 e1iypdkw1">'Wheel of Fortune' Host<br></h2><img alt="pat sajak and vanna white smile for a posed photo while standing in front of a wheel with money slices, he wears a black suit jacket, white collared shirt, and multicolored tie, she wears a gold glittery one shoulder dress with feathers on the strap" title="Pat Sajak and Vanna White in an undated photo" width=2147 height=3000 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/pictured-pat-sajak-vanna-white-photo-by-ron-tom-nbcu-photo-news-photo-1695214568.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><span class="css-eqbp25 eewc14j1">Getty Images</span><p>Pat Sajak and Vanna White have hosted Wheel of Fortune together since 1982.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=15 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Later in 1982, however, White got the job that would make her career.

The show met with tremendous success over the next several years, and by 1986, a syndicated evening version attracted 30 million viewers—twice as many as the No. 2 syndicated program, M*A*S*H—and grossed $100 million a year. In 1999, its 16th year in syndication, Wheel of Fortune was seen by approximately 40 million people.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=16 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">White’s position as co-host and chief letter-turner while modeling of an ever-changing line of designs on Wheel of Fortune quickly made her a huge star. Suddenly, “Vannamania” was sweeping the nation, and White soon earned a number of lucrative endorsement contracts and even starred in the NBC movie Venus: The Goddess of Love. While more skeptical media observers mocked White for her limited acting ability and her position on Wheel as a non-speaking clotheshorse, the majority of viewers developed a liking to her, due in no small part to her beauty, energy, and constant charisma. Her popularity as an icon peaked during the mid- to late 1980s.</p><h6 class="css-9e7625 e9ikml3"><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p0"></span><span class="css-8lle59 e9ikml1">Up Next</span><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p1"></span></h6><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=18 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">In 1992, White was recognized in The Guinness Book of World Records as TV’s most frequent clapper, with an average of 720 claps per show and over 28,000 per season.
