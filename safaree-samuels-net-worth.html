He’s also released a number of projects and singles, performing in collaboration with various groups and artists.</p><p>How rich is Safaree Samuels? Sources estimate that his net worth is over $2 million as of early 2016, most of which can be attributed to his success in the music industry. He’s also received a fair share of wealth being heavily involved with the majority of <a href=#>Nicki Minaj’s</a> career. Aside from that, his collaborations and releases have helped maintain his riches.</p><h3>Safaree Samuels Net Worth $2 Million</h3><p>Safaree attended Midtown High School and later started his career in music rapping with the group Hoodstars, which also featured <a href=#>Nicki Minaj</a>, Lou$tar and Svn-up. Safaree’s net worth started to rise at this point as Hoodstars found success in the 2000s, and later Samuels started dating <a href=#>Nicki Minaj</a> – he even joined her when she started getting recognition as a solo artist. Safaree became known as a producer and hype man for some of <a href=#>Nicki Minaj’s</a> songs; he was the co-executive producer and A&R coordinator for “Pink Friday: Roman Reloaded”. The relationship was mostly rumors, until it was confirmed on VH1’s the “Fabulous Life: <a href=#>Nicki Minaj</a>”.</p><p>After their breakup, Samuels started focusing his efforts back towards music and began to work on his “Stunt Gang” imprint. One of the few songs that he was known for prior to “Stunt Gang” was released in late2011-2012. They were entitled “That’s My Watch” and “Count it Up”. The songs he released and those he produced earned a significant amount of attention, including the song “Can’t Lie” ft. Olaf which is featured in the January 2016 edition of Billboard Magazine.</p><p>In part of his less-than-private personal life, Safaree and <a href=#>Nicki</a> actually dated for around 12 years before calling it quits in 2014, ending on a bad note with Nicki allegedly chasing Samuels out of her house with a baseball bat, and proceeding to beat up a Mercedes Benz that belonged to her, but was being borrowed by Samuels. After their breakup, the two began firing off at each other using social media, hiding their intent with subliminal messages. The feud even went to music with <a href=#>Nicki</a> releasing an album regarding their relationship and Safaree releasing a song about Nicki and her current boyfriend entitled “Lifeline”. Following the split, Safaree went on to do interviews stating that he was essentially <a href=#>Nicki’s</a> ghost writer. The other refuted by announcing during the 2015 BET awards that “Anything <a href=#>Nicki Minaj</a> spit, <a href=#>Nicki Minaj</a> wrote”. While there are two sides of the story, Safaree claims that in their relationship, he was treated more of an employee, so he walked away.</p><p>After all the controversy and issues surrounding Samuels and <a href=#>Minaj’s</a> failed relationship, Safaree has been rumoured to be dating other women though nothing has been confirmed. Aside from information about his music career, not much is known about Safaree’s life, his past, family and education remains private to most.</p>﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿<h3 class=toggle-head>Actor <span class="fa fa-angle-down" aria-hidden=true></span></h3><table class=actor readability=1><tr><th>Title</th><th>Year</th><th>Status</th><th>Character</th></tr><tr><td>Caught the Series</td><td>2017</td><td>TV Series</td><td>Jamaican boss</td></tr><tr><td>Caught</td><td>2017</td><td>TV Series</td><td>Jamaican boss</td></tr><tr readability=2><td>Nicki Minaj: Come on a Cone</td><td>2012</td><td>Video short</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Nicki Minaj: Stupid Hoe</td><td>2012</td><td>Video short</td><td></td></tr></table><h3 class=toggle-head>Composer <span class="fa fa-angle-down" aria-hidden=true></span></h3><table class=composer readability=1><tr><th>Title</th><th>Year</th><th>Status</th><th>Character</th></tr><tr><td>Nicki Minaj: Stupid Hoe</td><td>2012</td><td>Video short</td><td></td></tr><tr readability=2><td>Nicki Minaj: Did It On'em</td><td>2011</td><td>Video short</td><td></td></tr></table><h3 class=toggle-head>Thanks <span class="fa fa-angle-down" aria-hidden=true></span></h3><table class=thanks readability=1><tr><th>Title</th><th>Year</th><th>Status</th><th>Character</th></tr><tr readability=2><td>Nicki Minaj: My Time Now</td><td>2010</td><td>TV Movie documentary special thanks</td><td></td></tr></table><h3 class=toggle-head>Self <span class="fa fa-angle-down" aria-hidden=true></span></h3><table class=self readability=2><tr><th>Title</th><th>Year</th><th>Status</th><th>Character</th></tr><tr readability=2><td>Scared Famous</td><td>2017</td><td>TV Series post-production</td><td>Himself</td></tr><tr readability=2><td>Love & Hip Hop: Hollywood</td><td>2016-2017</td><td>TV Series</td><td>Himself</td></tr><tr><td>Wild 'N Out</td><td>2017</td><td>TV Series</td><td>Himself - Performer</td></tr><tr><td>Hip Hop Squares</td><td>2017</td><td>TV Series</td><td>Himself - Panelist</td></tr><tr><td>K.Michelle: My Life</td><td>2016</td><td>TV Series</td><td>Himself</td></tr></table><h3>Known for movies</h3><br><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmimlanEsL7Toaeoq6RjvLOzjqyYn5mimrJuv8CmrJ6ko2K7psCMsKarrJhk</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fsafaree-samuels-net-worth.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fsafaree-samuels-net-worth.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fsafaree-samuels-net-worth.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fsafaree-samuels-net-worth.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fsafaree-samuels-net-worth.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fsafaree-samuels-net-worth.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./echo-beats-deadpool-3-to-the-punch-as-marvels-first-mature-rated-project-under-disney.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./echo-beats-deadpool-3-to-the-punch-as-marvels-first-mature-rated-project-under-disney.html>Echo beats Deadpool 3 to the punch as Marvels first mature-rated project under Disney</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./priyal-gor.html>Priyal Gor Biography, Facts &amp;amp; Life Story</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./priyal-gor.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
