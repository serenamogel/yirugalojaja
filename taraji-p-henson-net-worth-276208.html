She was raised alongside two siblings and shared an especially deep relationship with her grandmother. Taraji means "hope" in Swahili while Penda means "love." Henson graduated from high school in 1988, and she then attended North Carolina Agricultural and Technical State University to study electrical engineering.

She played the love interest of the lead character, and the film won multiple awards.</p><p>In 2008, Henson was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress after appearing in The Curious Case of Benjamin Button. That year, she also appeared in Tyler Perry's The Family That Preys before taking a role in 2009's I Can Do Bad All By Myself. She also appeared in the 2010 remake of The Karate Kid, which was a commercial success despite poor reviews.</p><p class=wp-caption-text id=caption-attachment-298355>Kevork Djansezian/Getty Images</p><p>Next, Henson played the central role in Taken From Me: The Tiffany Rubin Story, earning an Emmy Award for her performance.

Henson appeared in films such as Proud Mary and Acrimony before taking a voice acting role in Disney's Ralph Breaks The Internet. In 2019, she starred in What Men Want, a reboot of the Mel Gibson film What Women Want.</p><p>Over the years, Henson has appeared in a wide range of television series. She has taken guest-starring roles in shows like CSI: Crime Scene Investigation and House. Henson also booked recurring roles on shows such as The Division and Boston Legal. Perhaps her best known recurring role was in the critically acclaimed show Empire. This 2015 series helped Taraji P.

Thanks to her work on Empire, Henson won a Golden Globe for Best Actress in 2016.</p><p>Personal Life: Henson has one son, Marcell, who was born in 1994. His father was Henson's high school sweetheart, but he was murdered in 2003. In 2014, her son was detained by police officers, who found marijuana and Ritalin without a prescription in his car. After initially complaining that her son had been racially profiled, Henson backtracked on her statements and apologized to the police.</p><p>Taraji P.
