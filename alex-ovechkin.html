The son of famous Soviet era-athletes, Ovechkin was widely considered one of the world’s top young hockey players by age 17. He was selected No. 1 overall by Washington in the 2004 NHL Draft and was named Rookie of the Year in his first season. Ovechkin led the Capitals to their only Stanley Cup championship in 2018 and has set multiple NHL records during his career.

He is the son of well-known Soviet-era athletes. His mother, Tatyana, excelled at basketball and was a two-time Olympic gold medalist. His father, Mikhail, was a serious soccer player.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=10 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Ovechkin’s childhood was shaped by modesty. Not long after his birth, he moved with his family to the outskirts of Moscow, making a home in a tall high-rise building that was surrounded by a crumbling neighborhood. To escape his surroundings and strict public school, Ovechkin turned to hockey, pouring everything he had into the sport.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=11 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">By age 16, Ovechkin had begun playing with the Moscow Dynamo, a pro Russian team. A year later, he became the youngest member of Russia’s national team.</p><img alt="alex ovechkin wearing a capitals jersey and posing for photos on his draft night" title="Alex Ovechkin was drafted by the Washington Capitals in June 2004" width=3000 height=2038 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/commisioner-gary-bettman-unknown-scout-ross-mahoney-1-news-photo-1696959985.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><span class="css-eqbp25 eewc14j1">Getty Images</span><p>Alex Ovechkin poses with Washington Capitals ownership following his selection during the 2004 NHL Entry Draft.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=13 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Spurred to escape Russia where his older brother, Sergei, died in a car crash, and many of his friends were becoming addicted to drugs, Ovechkin dreamed of playing in the NHL. In his bedroom, he carefully stashed away the cards of many players, including his idol Mario Lemieux.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=14 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Considered a hockey phenom in his native country, Ovechkin soon earned the praise of NHL scouts. As his game took off, his confidence soared. At the 2002 Under-18 World Championships in Slovakia, the young forward led the tournament with 14 goals in just eight games.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=15 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">“It’s the best hockey there is,” Ovechkin said of the NHL. “And I think I’m ready to play there, wherever I’m drafted.” In the end, the highly prized and touted Ovechkin went No. 1 overall to the Washington Capitals in the 2004 NHL Entry Draft.<br></p><h2 data-node-id=16 title="NHL Career" data-anchor-id=nhl-career class="body-h2 css-a5dq20 e1iypdkw1">NHL Career</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=17 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">After missing a year due to the league’s season-long lockout in 2004-05, Ovechkin made his NHL debut with a bang in October 2005, potting two goals in just four minutes and checking an opponent so hard that he broke the glass partition. He went on to net 52 goals and register 54 assists that season, winning the Calder Memorial Trophy as the league’s Rookie of the Year.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=18 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">In the years following, the Russian superstar—best known for his booming slap shot—became one of the NHL’s most explosive and feared scorers. During the 2007-08 season, Ovechkin scored 65 times and dished out 47 assists to capture his first Hart Trophy as the league’s MVP. The following season, Ovechkin won the Hart for the second time. He earned a third MVP honor following the 2012-13 season.</p><h6 class="css-9e7625 e9ikml3"><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p0"></span><span class="css-8lle59 e9ikml1">Biographies of Other NHL Greats</span><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p1"></span></h6><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=21 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Ovechkin firmly established himself one of the league’s top scorers, netting 50 or more goals in four of his next six campaigns. However, playoff success proved elusive for the Capitals, who never made it past the second round in any of Ovechkin’s seasons through 2016-17.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=22 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">But in 2018, with the help of playmaking forwards Evgeny Kuznetsov and Nicklas Backstrom, Ovechkin scored 49 goals and led Washington to the Metropolitan Division title. He kept up his torrid scoring pace in the playoffs, and the Capitals beat the Columbus Blue Jackets, Pittsburgh Penguins, and Tampa Bay Lightning to advance to the Stanley Cup Final against the Vegas Golden Knights.</p><img alt="alex ovechkin smiling and yelling as he takes the stanley cup from gary bettman" title="Alex Ovechkin and the Washington Capitals win the Stanley Cup" width=4208 height=2805 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/alex-ovechkin-of-the-washington-capitals-is-presented-the-news-photo-1696958797.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><span class="css-eqbp25 eewc14j1">Getty Images</span><p>Alex Ovechkin receives the Stanley Cup from NHL Commissioner Gary Bettman after the Washington Capitals won the league championship in 2018.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=24 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Washington beat Vegas in five games to win the first and only Stanley Cup in franchise history.

Two seasons later, he won the Art Ross Trophy as season points leader and his first of nine NHL scoring titles. The 12-time NHL All-Star has earned three awards each for the league’s MVP and Most Outstanding Player.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=28 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">As of October 19, 2023, Alex Ovechkin has 822 total regular season goals and 72 playoff goals for a combined 894 goals.
